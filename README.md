# Catto & Doggo Classification with Tensorflow

## Hi there!
This classifer was trained on the infamous model: __Xception__ using Transfer Learning. It archieved ~99% accuracy on train set and ~94% on validation set.    

Due to Github's file size limitation, the parameter h5 file and the dataset are not included in this repo. The test the Flask app yourself: 
- Download the h5 file [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wIFV0bjNtdZ6Ul4ataD9W6eo-6PxNxVq?usp=sharing)
- Save the h5 file to _static_ folder
- In your terminal, navigate to this folder then type `python3 app.py`

__Note:__ 
- You might need to install some additional Python libraries. Check at `app.py`.
- This app is using Tensorflow 2.0. Make sure you install it instead of earlier versions: `pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-rc0 `
